# Overwatch Patch Compare Tool

This tool compares the balance changes between any two Overwatch patches. It is useful for understanding how the game has evolved over time and how the developers have attempted to balance the game. It includes patches back to Overwatch 1's release in May 2016. Access it online [here](https://devon7925.github.io/overwatch_patch_compare).

The repo also contains data on every hero.

## Disclaimer

The data for this tool was collected via records rather than first hand measurement and could therefore be inaccurate in places. If you find an inaccuracy please submit an issue. In addition there are some things mentioned in the patch notes that I couldn't get enough information about to include them in the data. There is a list of these [here](./unadded_changes.md). If you can find numbers for any of these feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
