* Sojourn `Secondary fire damage now scales linearly with energy from 30 to 130 damage (1 energy converts to 1 damage added)` (how tf did it work before)
* Pharah `Reload starts 0.25 seconds sooner when out of ammo` What tf? is there a delay on reload when out of ammo,
* Junkrat `Projectiles preserve slightly more velocity on ricochet.` How much more? How much was there before?
* Zarya `Beam damage now scales from 75-170 damage-per-second, down from 95-170` minimum damage was later increased from 85 so I'm not sure when it was increased to 85 from 75
